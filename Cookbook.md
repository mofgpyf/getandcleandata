## Codebook for average_activity_subject.txt

### Dataset information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### Attribute Information:
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
* Its activity label. 
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### How the data was cleaned
First the training and test datasets were merged.
Next, only the mean and standard deviation variables were retained.
Next, the activity description was added.
Next, the columns were labelled with more intuitive names.
Finally, the average of each activity and subject was calculated.

### Variables
Each row listed the subject, followed by each activity and the mean of of the measurements in 3-axes. 

1. The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk). 
2. The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
3. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (The 'f'-prefix indicates frequency domain signals). 
4. Additional vectors were obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable: gravityMean, tBodyAccMean, tBodyAccJerkMean, tBodyGyroMean,tBodyGyroJerkMean. 
5. The suffix .mean/std in the variable name reflects the mean or standard deviation of the measurement.
6. The suffix .X/Y/Z in the variable name reflects the direction of a 3-axial signal.
7. The suffix .mean in the variable name reflects global mean value.
